# OCULUS

This project was pursued as an Internship project in the Microsoft Innovation Labs, under Dr. B Niranjana Krupa, during the summer of 2018.


PROBEM STATEMENT :
  Oculus used Electrooculagraphy signals to move a cursor on the screen.

MATERIALS USED :

  The data was collected using the OpenBCI Cython Board (https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel?variant=38958638542)
  Five gold cup electrodes (https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-gold-cup-electrodes?variant=9056028163) were placed on five different position near the eyes (please refer to the pdf for exact postions) to record readings.
  Conductive paste (https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/ten20-conductive-paste-2oz-jars?variant=31373533198)
  
RECORDING THE DATA :
  
  A pygame simulation (developed by us) was run where the cursor rotated in the rectangle around the screen.
  Whenever the cursor reached the corner of the screen the respondent was asked to blink.
  The data was collected across 5 different users multiple times.
